Create a Luggage class.
• Write the data members.
• Write a non-default constructor takes belongsTo, weight_kilo and capacity_lt as parameter and
assigns the values. Also, sets the lastUsedId as the object’s luggage_ID and increments it.
• Write get methods for luggage_ID, belongsTo, weight_kilo and capacity_lt.
• Write a toString() method that returns luggage_ID, belongsTo, weight_kilo and capacity_lt.
Create a LuggageList class.
• Write a static final members MAX_COUNT with value of 5 which latter determines the size of the object
array, and MAX_KILOS with value of 50. Since, the available helicopter’s cargo capacity allows up to 5
luggage with total of 50 kilos maximum.
• Write an object array myLuggages[] created from Luggage class, with MAX_COUNT as size.
• Write a data member named total_LuggageCount to store the number of luggage that system has.
• Write an addLuggage() method, that takes a Luggage object as parameter and check if the array is full.
If it’s not full, add the Luggage object to the Luggage object array and returns true. If the array is full,
returns false.
• Write a removeLuggage() method that takes the luggage_ID of the Luggage to be removed. Search the
sarray to find the given id (Since the type of the parameter is String, you will have to parse it to integer).
If found, move the last element of the array to the index of the found item and decrement count. If
successful, return true, otherwise returns false.
• Write a getLuggage() method that takes ‘belongs to’ information as parameter, searches for that
luggage in the object array. If found, return the object, otherwise, return null.
• Write a getAll() method that returns myLuggages object array.
• Write a getHighestCapacityLuggage() method that searches for the luggage with the highest
capacity and returns that luggage object.
• Write a display() method that prints all the luggage objects’ information in the object array to console.
Create a Main Class called Cargo.
• In main method, do the following.
o Input 5 luggages and store them into a LuggageList object.
o You will scan capacity information as width:height:length in cm like 10:10:10 and convert it to
liters, thus, try split method of String objects. (HINT: 1000 cm3 equals to 1 liter)
o Display the contents of LuggageList object by using toString method.
o Ask the user which luggage to remove and then remove it.
o Ask the user which luggage to search and then display it.
o Display the luggage with highest capacity.
